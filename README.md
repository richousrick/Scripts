# Scripts
Misc scripts primarily focusing around penetration testing.

Current Scripts:

- Bat
  +  cmd - a bat script that mimics cmd,
        useful to access cmd where it has been blocked but command prompt script processing has not 


- Java
  +  Hide - Hides a given file on dos and unix based systems 
  +  UnHide - Does the opposite to above


- Bash
  + compilejava - takes a given *.java and compiles it to a runnable *.jar
